# digital-clock
100% assembly clock project

<h2>Description</h2>
This project consists of a digital clock that runs on a 16 bit processor connected to an LCD PixelScreen and to buttons. 
It's been built for a virtual simulated 16 bit processor (PEPE - Processador Especial para Ensino) and it should work on most 16 bit processors.
